This repo contains the back-end of the CakeTracker Application. Please feeel free to clone it and use it with a PostgreSQL Database (you can manage postgre databases from pgAdmin 4). Configure a server on pgAdmin setting username=postgres and password=abcd1234 or change the username and password in the app in application.properties with your own to correspond.

After setting up the backend, please clone the front-end repository (I suggest you open the project with Visual Studio Code or a similar IDE) and start both applications. 

Make sure backend is running on port localhost:8080 and frontend on localhost:3000. 

The reqests can be tested in Postman or Insomnia before actually using the app.
